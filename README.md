## Overview
This project aims to determine the temperature at the surface of a new unknown star at any time, from a few observations.
It is known that the temperature follows a function called Weierstrass, defined as follows:
$$t(i)=\sum_{n=0}^c a^n\times \cos(b^n\pi i)$$ 
Where $t(i)$ is the star temperature at a given time i, with the following set of parameters:


## Requirements
The requirements.txt file list all Python libraries that the project depends on.  
To install, use the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting started
There are two ways to use this project:
#### Google colab
